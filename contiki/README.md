WIMEA-ICT AWS Remote control and Configuration system is intended to provide mechanisms for remotely controlling and configuring the WIMEA-ICT AWS sensor nodes. The system shall enable users to remotely send commands to the sensor nodes in order to reboot them, get information about the node such as the reporting interval. Synchronizing information of the sensor nodes with the sink node shall also be acquired to establish the wake- up and sleep times of the nodes in order to reduce data loses. The commands sent will be used to reset the gateway time in case a drift in the clock is detected, modifying the sensor node report masks and, reprogramming the sensor nodes over the air.
